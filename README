

The UVM SDV project provides software-driven verification (SDV) extensions to UVM. Specifically,
the project enables connections between the UVM and embedded-software portions of a testbench.

There are several key components of infrastructure in the UVM SDVM extensions:
- Transport layer: Manages sending messages between UVM and SW. The transport layer is
  designed for modularity, so different mechanisms can be used without substantive 
  changes to the UVM SDV library or test.
  Two transports are provided:
  - DPI-based transport used for testing.
  - Shared memory-based transport based on polling (ie not interrupt-driven).
  
- C API: Provide services to C/C++ embedded software tests to synchronize and
  interact with the UVM testbench
  - Get configuration values from the UVM configuration database. Note that the
    config variables are obtained from the UVM SDV 'connector' component. In other
    words, in most cases some action must be taken in the UVM testbench to make
    config variables available to the C test.
  - Receive transactions from sequences running on a 'uvm_sdv_driver' in the
    UVM testbench.
  - Send transactions to an analysis port in the UVM testbench
  - Launch sequences in the UVM testbench and monitor their completion status.

- UVM Components: 
  - UVM SDV Connector: Specific implementations of the connector implement 
    specific transports, such as DPI-based or shared memory 
  - UVM SDV Driver: Driver that packs transactions received from the running
    sequence and sends them to the SW test via the UVM SDV Connector.
  - UVM SDV Analysis publisher: receives transactions from the C test and publishes
    them in the UVM environment.

== Running Tests ==
The 'simple_dpi' testbench uses the DPI-based transport. Host-compiled C tests are used to
test the SDV library implementation.
A 'test' in this environment really consists of a UVM test class and a C test file. For example:
tests/simple_dpi_ap_test.svh and tests/sw/uvm_sdv_ap_test.c together test the analysis-port
functionality.

In order to run these tests, it is assumed you have Questa 10.4 or greater installed and
the tools (eg vsim, vlog) available in the path. If running on a 64-bit machine, the 
64-bit version of Questa must be installed.

- First, change directory to the examples/simple_dpi/sim directory
% cd examples/simple_dpi/sim

- Next, source the setup script in the 'common' directory. Note that Bourne shell (or Bash) is assumed
% . ../../simscripts/set_env.sh
    
- Next, run a test using the runtest.pl script
% runtest.pl -test tests/uvm_sdv_ap_test.f

- To run all the tests:
% runtest.pl -testlst testlists/alltests.tl
